### Current Focus

I have a great many interests, so I can only juggle a few at a time. Right now:

* Full-time senior systems administrator, working with:
  * Hyper-V
  * Windows Server
  * RedHat/CentOS Linux
  * Citrix technologies
  * Real-time location systems (infants, staff duress alarms, and assets)
* I actively contribute to the technical community:
  * Projects here on GitHub
  * Blogging about Hyper-V, hosted by [Altaro](https://www.altaro.com/hyper-v/author/eric-siron/)
  * Helping to set up [Project Runspace], a (eventually) non-profit dedicated to bringing up the next generation of systems administrators, with a focus on disadvantaged communities.
  * Writing a number of books
  
Unfortunately, this workload means that I've had to sideline or even abandon some projects. I don't lack passion for them, just time! Most of that work appears here on GitHub, and I will happily accept community contributions. In particular, I think a lot of people would really like some meaningful updates to [Corefig](https://github.com/ejsiron/Corefig). I have a lot of private code written for a complete replacement, but I have no idea when I'll get back to it.
