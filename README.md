## Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Eric Siron

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him

I've been quiet for a while as I worked toward a Master of Business Administration degree. I recently completed my coursework and have started back into my projects.

### Current Focus

I do hold down a full time systems administrator job, working mainly with:

* Hyper-V
* Windows Server
* Ubuntu Linux and RedHat/CentOS Linux
* Citrix technologies
* Real-time location systems (infants, staff duress alarms, and assets)

My public contribution work:
* Projects here on GitHub
* Helping to set up [Project Runspace](https://projectrunspace.org), a (eventually) non-profit dedicated to bringing up the next generation of systems administrators, with a focus on disadvantaged communities.
* Writing books on CIM/WMI, systems administration, and other topics.

Once upon a time, I frequently contributed articles to a blog hosted by [Altaro](https://www.altaro.com/hyper-v/author/eric-siron/). I have plans to continue working with their new owner, Hornet Security, in podcasts and written material.
  
Unfortunately, this workload means that I've had to sideline or even abandon some projects. I don't lack passion for them, just time! Most of that work appears here on GitHub, and I will happily accept community contributions. In particular, I think a lot of people would really like some meaningful updates to [Corefig](https://github.com/ejsiron/Corefig). I have a lot of private code written for a complete replacement, but I have no idea when I'll get back to it.
